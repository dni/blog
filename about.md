I love technology, programming, linux, synthesizer, math, art and countless other things, some people would call me nerd. I'm from austria and in 2012 i started my company [dnilabs e.U]({{site.website}}) which is specialized in all things around the world wide web, especially webdevelopment and hosting. I discovered bitcoin in 2013 and it took me until 2020 that i finally started to work full time on bitcoin and related things :). Currently i am working on <a href="https://lnbits.com" target="_blank">LNbits</a> and <a href="https://boltz.exchange">Boltz</a>.
