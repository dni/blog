Hi! My name is Daniel Krahofer
---
I love technology, programming, linux, synthesizer, math, art and countless other things, some people would call me nerd. I'm from austria and in 2012 i started my company [dnilabs e.U]({{site.website}}) which is specialized in all things around the world wide web, especially webdevelopment and hosting.

I always wanted something like a blog where i could write about some problems i struggled with and solution for them, fun projects i do for free and with my friends, ideas i wanna talk about, workflow optimisations and maybe opinions on different things like new technology, politics, etc.

<b>Finally</b> in 2018 i spun up this jekyll blog on github pages and now im trying to add new posts whenever i can and hopefully provide something of value for some of you reading this blog. EDIT 21.06.2021: :D didnt blog as much as i hoped for, but as of now i'm very motivated again to gets things going, especially with the pinephone stuff, which is very exciting for me.

can i help you?
