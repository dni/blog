Hi! My name is Daniel Krahofer
---
I love technology, programming, linux, synthesizer, math, art and countless other things, some people would call me nerd. I'm from Austria and in 2012 i started my company [dnilabs e.U](https://www.dnilabs.at) which is specialized in all things around the world wide web, especially webdevelopment and hosting.

I always wanted something like a blog where i could write about some problems i struggled with and solution for them, fun projects i do for free and with my friends, ideas i wanna talk about, workflow optimisations and maybe my opinion on different news related things like new technology, politics, etc.

<b>Finally</b> in 2018 i spun up this jekyll blog on github pages and now im trying to add new posts whenever i can and hopefully provide something of value for some of you reading this blog.



Questions, Suggestions, Errors?

If there is anything you want to ask, suggest, say or correct just go to my [github issue site](https://github.com/dni/blog/issues) and feel free to create a new one, i try to reply asap.
