hi!
---
I love technology, programming, linux, synthesizer, math, art and countless other things, some people would call me nerd. I'm from austria and in 2012 i started my company [dnilabs e.U]({{site.website}}) which is specialized in all things around the world wide web, especially webdevelopment and hosting. I discovered bitcoin in 2013 and i took me until 2020 that i finally started to work full time on bitcoin and related things :).

chat?
