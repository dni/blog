I"Ë<p>A friend of mine, Patrick FÃ¼rli, is artists, he creates so called collage art, he takes pieces of magazine or paper, and rearranges them. He recently started creating animated gif files of his art and then he asked me: â€œdo you have any good idea how to play this gifs with music in an interactive art installation which i can afford?â€. He had some kind of big installation in mind with multiple monitors, speakers, raspberry pies and other stuff.</p>
