<p>I just discovered SXMO for the Pinephone yesterday and im amazed by it, its excatly how i imagined myself using the Pinephone and even better. I decided to look deeper into it. First of all there is only a prebuilt image for SXMO using PostmarketOS, which is nice, but i really prefer Arch Linux ARM.</p>
