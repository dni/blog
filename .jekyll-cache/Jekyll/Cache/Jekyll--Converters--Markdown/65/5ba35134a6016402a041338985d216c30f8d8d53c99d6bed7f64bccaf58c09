<p>==============
i began streaming on twitch recently and developing a lnbits extension was one of my first projects i coded on stream.</p>

<h2 id="the-idea">the idea</h2>
<p>============
inspired by some very cool already existing extensions of lnbits, i came up with day idea of creating an extension where you can configure your own SMTP server and be able to offer people to send ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù mails through your server for a couple of satoshis.</p>

<h2 id="the-execution">the execution</h2>
<p>================
the extension was developed rather quickly, despite beeing not very experienced with python. i learned a lot in a short period of time. beneath in the links section i linked the PR for the extension, a youtube video showing of the functionality and my twitter post :)</p>
