<p>I love technology, programming, linux, synthesizer, math, art and countless other things, some people would call me nerd. Iâ€™m from austria and in 2012 i started my company <a href="https://www.dnilabs.at/">dnilabs e.U</a> which is specialized in all things around the world wide web, especially webdevelopment and hosting.</p>

<p>I always wanted something like a blog where i could write about some problems i struggled with and solution for them, fun projects i do for free and with my friends, ideas i wanna talk about, workflow optimisations and maybe opinions on different things like new technology, politics, etc.</p>

<p><b>Finally</b> in 2018 i spun up this jekyll blog on github pages and now im trying to add new posts whenever i can and hopefully provide something of value for some of you reading this blog.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-help-you">can i help you?</h2>
<p>you think i can help you with a project? feel free to contact me!</p>

<h2 id="irc">irc?</h2>

<h2 id="dni">dni?</h2>
<p>dni is just a short for daniel and in the old days i used dni in irc chat as a nickname.</p>
