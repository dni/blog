<p>how easy is it to create your own DEX and earn referal money? not so easy, as we are discovering now.</p>

<h2 id="the-concept">the concept</h2>

<h3 id="the-idea">the idea</h3>
<p>the idea was to create a server host a GUI for a DEX and earn money by getting people to trade on our dex and earn referals, basically a copy of sites like <a href="https://dex.raydium.io">radium</a> and other projects of that kind, which is called ‚ÄúDEX‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="the-execution">the execution</h3>
<p>after some quick devops work, forking, installing and updating, we quickly discovered a problem with our project of choice <a href="https://github.com/project-serum/serum-dex-ui">Serum Dex Ui Example</a>. despite the documentation not mentioning it a bit, there is a subscription
for the datafeed you need to display correct chart data with tradingview on your DEX. the price is
1000‚Ç¨ per month to use their aggregated onchain data. bohoo, big bummer</p>

<h3 id="the-conclusion">the conclusion</h3>

<p>i spent 90% figuring out the complexity and the dependencies of the different services like ‚Äúserum‚Äù und ‚Äúbonfida‚Äù which is a paid subscription only to discover that without the data, you can pretty much only offer a orderbook directly from serum, but the question, will their service also become subscription only in the future? i‚Äôm not sure.</p>

<p>all that said, we still learned some valueable lessons and still here is some more stuff i gathered when trying to do this.</p>

<h4 id="hosting">hosting</h4>

<p>you can simply host it by creating a free github repository on github.com and fork the <a href="https://github.com/project-serum/serum-dex-ui">serum-dex-ui</a> repository, customize it, and enable github pages.
you can clone it locally, modify your wallet addresses and rebuild and deploy your app with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yarn deploy</code> and everything on github pages will be updated</p>
